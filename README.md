# STROKE PREDICTION MODEL

This project involves building and deploying a machine learning model to predict stroke occurrences using patient data. The goal is to create a tool that helps healthcare professionals identify individuals at high risk of stroke and provide timely intervention.

## Algorithms Used
- **Random Forest:** A robust and high-performance ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes for classification.

## Key Outcomes
- The Random Forest model achieved high accuracy in predicting stroke risk.
- The model is capable of handling various patient features, including demographic information, health history, and lifestyle factors.
- Deployment allows for real-time stroke risk prediction, aiding healthcare providers in decision-making.

## Tools and Libraries
- R
- `tidyverse`
- `ggplot2`
- `dplyr`
- `caret`
- `randomForest`
- `skimr`
- `gridExtra`
- `caTools`
- `corrplot`
- `ggcorrplot`
- `naniar`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Run the provided R scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
